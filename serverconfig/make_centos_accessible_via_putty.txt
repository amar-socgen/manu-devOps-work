**** Access centos created on vmware via putty ****

Steps to be followed on centos inorder to make it accessible via putty

1. Find out the ip address of the centos vm you are using.
   command : ip addr 
   
2. Make sure sshd service is runnig in the host.
   command : service sshd status

   if not then follow https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/centos-ssh/

3. Make sure port 22 is open
   command : netstat -tulnp ( if you get command not found for netstat, install it. command : yum install net-tools ) 

4. Use the ipaddress to login via putty.

NOTE : If you want to change the hostname and use that hostname to login via putty then follow the following steps

1. Find out your hostname of centos
   command : hostname -s  OR  cat /etc/hostname

2. In order to change or set a CentOS 7 machine hostname, use the hostnamectl command
   command : hostnamectl set-hostname your-new-hostname
   
3. Confirm the change in the hostname 
   command : hostname -s.   
   
4. In order to apply the new hostname, a system reboot is required. Reboot the vm.
   command : systemctl reboot

5 (important). Now your hostname is changed in the vm.
			   But inorder to use the same in putty, you need to map the ipaddress of the host to the hostname in windows.   
			   To do that :
			   * Open "hosts" file of windows as administrator (  path C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc )
			   * Add the ipaddress of the vm and the hostname to the file and save it.
			   
That's all you need to do.
Hurry! you are good to go.
